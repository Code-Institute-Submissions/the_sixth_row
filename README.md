# The Sixth Row 

This project is to showcase my own former band. We have a lot of unreleased music, photos and videos that have never been featured in a specifically designed
website. 

The project will be an easily usable four-page website that will enable the user to listen to music, watch videos, read info, view photos and contact the 
band, as well as see when upcoming shows are taking place. Also, links will be provided to other social media sites, such as YouTube, Facebook and Soundcloud.    

## UX

In order to make the user experience as easy and enjoyable as possible I opted for a straight forward layout design using colours that are included in 
The Sixth Row logo, mainly red, black and green. The original concept for the homepage can be seen in the *supporting_docs folder* *under homepage_wireframe* 
that I created in Balsamiq. Since the original idea for the homepage there have been a few modifications.

The website is aimed at existing fans of the band, as well as potential new fans and anyone interested in having us play at a gig, wedding, party etc. 
The individual will be able to listen to our music, watch videos, see photos and contact us via an online form and also, see if there are any upcoming 
gigs / shows

I believe that a website specifically for our band is the best way to showcase our back catalogue of music, videos and photos and the four pages utilised contain the correct amount of information required by the user. 
The website allows the user to perform actions such as:

•	Easily play songs in audio format on the homepage audio players under the tile ‘Music’. These audio clips have their own controls.
•	Read information about the band in the homepage biography / history section titles ‘Audio Smackdown’ and also in snippets of text that accompany the 
    videos. 
•	Easily play songs and shows in video format on the homepage and page titled ‘Shows / Videos. These videos have their own sets of controls and can be 
    full screened, dependent upon the user’s requirements.
•	View photos of the band and members in the header and also in the ‘Gigs / Members’ page. 
•	See upcoming gigs in the form of a flyer or potentially lit on the ‘Gigs / Members’ page.
•	Access various social media sites relating to the band (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Soundcloud) via easily recognisable links in the footer section that is 
    viewable at the base of every page.
•	Easily contact the band with an online contact form that can be used to request gigs or general info.  This can be done via the ‘Contact’ page, where   
    an easily managed form can be completed. There is also a link to the contact page via a button titled ‘contact’ in the footer.
